# Instruction

1) train_phone_finder.py ​ takes a single command line argument which is a path to a folder with labeled images and ​ labels.txt​ ​ that has been attached to this description. This script may generate any artifacts you want in the current folder.
Here is what a terminal command will look like:
> python train_phone_finder.py ~/find_phone

2) find_phone.py ​ takes a single command line argument which is a path to the jpeg image to be tested. This script may use data in the local folder previously generated by ​ train_phone_finder.py ​ . ​ ​ This script has to print the normalized coordinates of the phone detected on this test image in the format shown below.
Here is what a terminal command will look like. Please, notice space separated

# Improvement
This was created as part of an exercise and is by no mean production program. It requires the following improvement.

a. The tensorflow libraries used in the program are an old version and during the execution a lot of warnings are produced.
b. Model has not been fully optimized.
c. To deploy it in multiple platforms is necessary to create a package.
